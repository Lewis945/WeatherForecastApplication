# WeatherForecastApplication

This is the project that gets the current weather forecast for a specific longitude and latitude.
It contains: WeatherForecast library, WeatherForecatRestApi project and WeatherForecastTests test project. 
To make it work you need to put appsecrets.json file to the root of WeatherForecatRestApi.

The file template is:
```
{
  "WeatherForecastSecrets": {
    "OpenWeatherMap": "***********",
    "DarkSky": "***********"
  }
}
```
